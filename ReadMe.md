# Improved Building Level Infoview
The Building Level infoview is improved as follows:
- The base game has 1 building level selector for all zone types.
  Replace the game's 1 selector with 4 selectors, 1 building level selector for each zone type (residential, commercial, industrial, office).
- The base game uses red, yellow, green colors to indicate building levels.
  Replace base game colors with 5 colors for each zone type corresponding to the building levels.
- The base game has a selector for only residential signature buildings.
  Add selectors for commercial, industrial, and office signature buildings.

# Compatibility
The mod is translated into all the languages supported by the base game.

There are no known compatibility issues with any other mods.
However, this mod is likely to conflict with any other mod that also modifies the Map Legend of the Building Level infoview.

This mod can be safely disabled or unsubscribed at any time.
